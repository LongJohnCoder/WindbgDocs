<H1><A NAME="Extensions_DG_188c35a9-449b-47eb-99ac-ffbd69ff5953.xml"></A>Anatomy of a DbgEng Extension DLL</H1>
<P>A DbgEng extension DLL exports a number of callback functions, some of which may be implementations of extension commands.</P>
<P>These extension DLLs are loaded by the <a href="dbg_glossary_e3f0f980-4b88-4e00-934b-0443c9640c06.xml.htm#cc3d62e3-661f-4077-bb5b-189750153eae">debugger engine</a> and can provide extra functionality or automation of tasks while performing <a href="dbg_glossary_fa191f80-14a9-47a0-bf4a-13d29c85162b.xml.htm#1a7518e7-05c9-4be8-baf0-63b4024f4e30">user-mode</a> or <a href="dbg_glossary_25516462-f653-424b-9a0c-f6d3ca1bb457.xml.htm#714fb29e-5a07-45f9-99e8-e3f319e69c2f">kernel-mode debugging</a> on Microsoft Windows.</P>
<P>If you performed a full install of Debugging Tools for Windows, a sample DbgEng extension called "exts" can be found in the sdk\samples\exts subdirectory of the installation directory.</P>
<H4>Extension Commands</H4>
<P></P>
<P>An extension DLL may export any number of functions that are used to execute extension commands.  Each function is explicitly declared as an export in the <i>.def</i> file, and its name must consist entirely of lowercase letters.</P>
<P>Functions used to implement extension commands must match the prototype <a href="extensions_ref_fc621d91-0419-4ae3-8e53-71f4c522c318.xml.htm">PDEBUG_EXTENSION_CALL</a>.</P>
<P>These functions are named according to the standard C++ convention, except that uppercase letters are not permitted. The exported function name and the extension command name are identical, except that the extension command begins with an exclamation point ( <b>!</b> ). For example, when you load <i>myextension.dll</i> into the debugger and then type <b>!stack</b> into the Debugger Command window, the debugger looks for an exported function named <b>stack</b> in <i>myextension.dll</i>.</P>
<P>If <i>myextension.dll</i> is not already loaded, or if there may be other extension commands with the same name in other extension DLLs, you can type <b>!myextension.stack</b> into the Debugger Command window to indicate the extension DLL and the extension command in that DLL.</P>
<H4>Other Exported Functions</H4>
<P>A DbgEng extension DLL must export <a href="extensions_ref_e260c42c-8299-4578-8919-3b2167701275.xml.htm"><b>DebugExtensionInitialize</b></a>.  This will be called when the DLL is loaded, to initialize the DLL.  It may be used by the DLL to initialize global variables.</P>
<P>An extension DLL may export <a href="extensions_ref_76594e24-5f2d-495f-b8a9-6acec1f21ba4.xml.htm"><b>DebugExtensionUninitialize</b></a>.  If this is exported, it will be called before the extension DLL is unloaded.  It may be used by the DLL to clean up before it is unloaded.</P>
<P>An extension DLL may export <a href="extensions_ref_18dd6999-773d-42e8-826a-dcac1fc1ed35.xml.htm"><b>DebugExtensionNotify</b></a>.  If this is exported, it will be called when a session begins or ends, and when a target starts or stops executing.  These notifications are also provided to <a href="comcallbacks_72745555-ec34-41fa-9305-cf23357bcd17.xml.htm"><b>IDebugEventCallbacks</b></a> objects registered with a client.</P>
<P>An extension DLL may export <a href="extensions_ref_dfff8fda-36a7-42ab-9ad7-1698c352c028.xml.htm"><b>KnownStructOutput</b></a>.  If this is exported, it will be called when the DLL is loaded. This function returns a list of structures that the DLL knows how to print on a single line.  It may be called later to format instances of these structures for printing.</P>
<H4>Engine Procedure for Loading a DbgEng Extension DLL</H4>
<P>When an extension DLL is loaded, the callback functions are called by the engine in the following order:</P><B></B><OL type="1">
<LI><b>DebugExtensionInitialize</b> is called so the extension DLL can initialize.</LI>
<LI>If exported, <b>DebugExtensionNotify</b> is called if the engine has an active session, and called again if the session is <a href="dbg_glossary_5048ec26-b9ce-44eb-afe2-ebb3e1c9e47d.xml.htm#0a6b6a99-2d54-46ab-99eb-d47231b221e6">suspended</a> and accessible.</LI>
<LI>If exported, <b>KnownStructOutput</b> is called to request a list of structures the DLL knows how to print on a single line.</LI>
</OL>
<P>See <a href="r08_use_remote_ac80d1f3-ff3f-4374-9e70-2a73b84ac647.xml.htm">Loading Debugger Extension DLLs</a> for information about how to use the debugger to load and unload an extension DLL, and see <a href="r08_use_remote_8493d413-185c-4d40-be6b-bd00cb61cc03.xml.htm">Using Debugger Extension Commands</a> for information about executing an extension command.</P>
<P>The debugger engine will place a <b>try / except</b> block around a call to an extension DLL.  This protects the engine from some types of bugs in the extension code; but, since the extension calls are executed in the same thread as the engine, they can still cause it to crash.</P>
