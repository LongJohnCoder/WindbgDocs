<P>The Debugging Tools for Windows package is available in three different versions: a 32-bit version, a native Intel Itanium version, and a native x64 version.</P>
<P>To determine which package to use, you have to know the processor that your <a href="r02_setup_1_3ababa5c-2202-4141-b689-a847cbfc3cb1.xml.htm">host computer</a> is running on.</P>
<H4>x86-based Host Computer</H4>
<P>If your host computer uses an x86-based processor, always use the 32-bit package.</P>
<H4>Itanium Host Computer</H4>
<P>If your host computer uses an Itanium-based processor, the following rules apply:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI>If you are analyzing a dump file, and if the dump file was made on Microsoft Windows XP or a later version of Windows, you can use the 32-bit package or the Itanium package. (It is not important whether the dump file is a user-mode dump file or a kernel-mode dump file, and it is not important whether the dump file was made on an x86-based or an Itanium-based platform.)    </LI>
<LI>If you are analyzing a dump file, and if the dump file was made on Windows 2000, you should use the 32-bit package. (It is not important whether the dump file is a user-mode dump file or a kernel-mode dump file)  </LI>
<LI>If you are performing live kernel-mode debugging, and if the target computer is running Windows XP or a later version of Windows, you can use the 32-bit package or the Itanium package. (This situation applies to both x86-based and Itanium-based targets.)    </LI>
<LI>If you are performing live kernel-mode debugging, and if the target computer is running Windows 2000, you should use the 32-bit package.  </LI>
<LI>If you are performing live user-mode debugging, always use the Itanium package. It is not important whether the target is a 64-bit application or a 32-bit application. The debugger that is included in the Itanium package can debug any kind of application and the <a href="dbg_glossary_39db479e-a9f5-4a31-b599-21aa77a0c60d.xml.htm#d3917b78-9dea-441e-99a1-d8cddce2b1a9">WOW64</a> emulator.    </LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<H4>x64-based Host Computer</H4>
<P>If your host computer uses an x64-based processor, the following rules apply:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI>If you are analyzing a dump file, and if the dump file was made on Windows XP or a later version of Windows, you can use either the 32-bit package or the x64 package. (It is not important whether the dump file is a user-mode dump file or a kernel-mode dump file, and it is not important whether the dump file was made on an x86-based or an x64-based platform.)    </LI>
<LI>If you are analyzing a dump file, and if the dump file was made on Windows 2000 operating system, you should use the 32-bit package. (It is not important whether the dump file is a user-mode dump file or a kernel-mode dump file)  </LI>
<LI>If you are performing live kernel-mode debugging, and if the target computer is running Windows XP or a later version of Windows, you can use either the 32-bit package or the x64 package. (This situation applies to both x86-based and x64-based targets.)    </LI>
<LI>If you are performing live kernel-mode debugging, and if the target computer is running Windows 2000, you should use the 32-bit package.  </LI>
<LI>If you are performing live user-mode debugging, use the x64 package for debugging WOW64 with both 64-bit and 32-bit code. To debug other targets, use a 32-bit debugger to debug 32-bit code.   </LI>
