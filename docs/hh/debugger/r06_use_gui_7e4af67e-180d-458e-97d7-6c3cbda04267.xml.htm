<P></P>
<H4>Named Workspaces</H4>
<P>Named workspaces contain additional information that is not stored in default workspaces.</P>
<P>This additional information includes information about the current session state. When a named workspace is saved, the current session is saved. If this workspace is later opened, this session is automatically restarted.</P>
<P>You can start only kernel debugging, dump file debugging, and debugging of spawned user-mode processes in this manner. Remote sessions and user-mode processes that the debugger attached to do not have this session information saved in their workspaces.</P>
<P>You cannot open this kind of named workspace if another session is already active.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>Debugging Clients and Workspaces</H4>
<P>When you use WinDbg as a <a href="dbg_glossary_e3f0f980-4b88-4e00-934b-0443c9640c06.xml.htm#cab89f06-8d34-430d-b047-ea48e96aac1b">debugging client</a>, its workspace saves only values that you set through the graphical interface. Changes that you make through the Debugger Command window are not saved. (This restriction guarantees that only changes that the local client made are reflected, because the Debugger Command window accepts input from all clients and the <a href="dbg_glossary_e3f0f980-4b88-4e00-934b-0443c9640c06.xml.htm#098e09f5-d7db-435e-9403-16661d6693b5">debugging server</a>.) For more information, see <a href="r08_use_remote_6a360dc5-a228-4746-a24e-13fc94f80fe2.xml.htm">Controlling a Remote Debugging Session</a>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="67a223d1-61aa-410c-85f6-353bfd082346"></A>Breakpoints in Workspaces</H3>
<P>In addition, breakpoint information is saved in workspaces, including the break address and status. Breakpoints that are active when a session ends are active when the next session is started. However, some of these breakpoints might be unresolved if the proper modules have not yet been loaded.</P>
<P>Breakpoints that you specify by a symbol expression, by a line number, by a numeric address, or by using the mouse in a Source window are all saved in workspaces. Breakpoints that you specify by using the mouse in a Disassembly or Calls window are <i>not</i> saved in workspaces.</P>
<P>If you are debugging multiple user-mode processes, only breakpoints that are associated with process zero are saved.</P>
