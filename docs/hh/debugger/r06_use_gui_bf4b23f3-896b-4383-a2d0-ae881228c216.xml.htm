<P>One useful window arrangement is to combine all of your <a href="r36_gui_1_ea5c9fec-a311-4ddc-8418-23737796865f.xml.htm">Source windows</a> into a single tabbed collection. The easiest way to do this is by marking your first source window as the tab-dock target for all Source windows by selecting the <b>Set as tab-dock target for window type</b> option in the Source window's short-cut menu. Once this is done, all future Source windows that are opened will automatically be included in a tabbed collection with this first Source window.  The Source window marked as the tab-dock target will not be closed when the <b>Window |</b> <b>Close All Source Windows</b> menu command is selected.  Thus you can set up a placeholder window for the Source windows that will only be closed when you want it to be.  </P>
<P>This collection can occupy half of the WinDbg window or you can put it in a separate dock.</P>
<P>If you want each debugging information window to be completely separate, you can create one dock for each window. This arrangement enables you to minimize or maximize each window separately.</P>
<P>If you want all of your windows to be floating, you should select <b>Always floating</b> on each window's shortcut menu so that you can drag each window independently to any location. </P>
<P>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="r37_gui_2_0a6c51df-cf39-4eb8-9a75-2fe5c47d8102.xml.htm"><b>MDI Emulation</b></a> command on the <b>Window</b> menu. This command makes all of the windows floating windows and constrains them within the frame window. This behavior emulates the behavior of WinDbg before the introduction of docking mode.</P>
<P>If you are using dual monitors, you can put the WinDbg window in one monitor and an extra dock in the other.</P>
<P>Some standard window arrangements for various debugging scenarios are included in the Debugging Tools for Windows package.  For details on these arrangements, see <a href="r06_use_gui_d9cc9129-a239-440f-a39d-3563bfe1408d.xml.htm">Using and Customizing WinDbg Themes</a>.</P>
