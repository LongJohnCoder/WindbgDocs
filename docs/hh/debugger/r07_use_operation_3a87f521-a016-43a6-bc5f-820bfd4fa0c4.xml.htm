<H1><A NAME="r07_use_operation_3a87f521-a016-43a6-bc5f-820bfd4fa0c4.xml"></A>Unresolved Breakpoints  (bu Breakpoints)</H1>
<P>If a <a href="r07_use_operation_b31049a1-efde-4f99-b82d-f47c3c7daf64.xml.htm">breakpoint</a> is set for a routine name that has not been loaded, the breakpoint is called a <i>deferred</i>, <i>virtual</i>, or <i>unresolved</i> breakpoint. (These terms are used interchangeably.) Unresolved breakpoints are not associated with any specific load of a module. Every time that a new application is loaded, it is checked for this routine name. If this routine appears, the debugger computes the actual coded address of the virtual breakpoint and enables the breakpoint.</P>
<P>If you set a breakpoint by using the <b>bu</b> command, the breakpoint is automatically considered unresolved. If this breakpoint is in a loaded module, the breakpoint is still enabled and functions normally. However, if the module is later unloaded and reloaded, this breakpoint does not vanish. On the other hand, a breakpoint that you set with <b>bp</b> is immediately resolved to an address.</P>
<P>There are three primary differences between <b>bp</b> breakpoints and <b>bu</b> breakpoints:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI>A <b>bp</b> breakpoint location is always converted to an address. If a module change moves the code at which a <b>bp</b> breakpoint was set, the breakpoint remains at the same address. On the other hand, a <b>bu</b> breakpoint remains associated with the symbolic value (typically a symbol plus an offset) that was used, and it tracks this symbolic location even if its address changes.</LI>
<LI>If a <b>bp</b> breakpoint address is found in a loaded module, and if that module is later unloaded, the breakpoint is removed from the breakpoint list.  On the other hand, <b>bu</b> breakpoints persist after repeated unloads and loads. </LI>
<LI>Breakpoints that you set with <b>bp</b> are not saved in WinDbg <a href="r06_use_gui_913ac9c6-536d-45c5-91b7-61369b2d2854.xml.htm">workspaces</a>. Breakpoints that are set with <b>bu</b> are saved in workspaces. </LI>
</UL>

<H4>Controlling Address Breakpoints and Unresolved Breakpoints</H4>
<P>Address breakpoints can be created with the <a href="r15_cmds_a_76c9b5bf-1e1a-4257-8bd4-4b00e2840523.xml.htm"><b>bp (Set Breakpoint)</b></a> command, or the <a href="r15_cmds_a_76c9b5bf-1e1a-4257-8bd4-4b00e2840523.xml.htm"><b>bm (Set Symbol Breakpoint)</b></a> command when the <b>/d</b> switch is included. Unresolved breakpoints can be created with the <a href="r15_cmds_a_76c9b5bf-1e1a-4257-8bd4-4b00e2840523.xml.htm"><b>bu (Set Unresolved Breakpoint)</b></a> command, or the <b>bm</b> command when the <b>/d</b> switch is not included.  Commands that disable, enable, and modify breakpoints apply to all kinds of breakpoints.  Commands that display a list of breakpoints include all breakpoints, and indicate the type of each. For a listing of these commands, see <a href="r07_use_operation_9046922f-e012-41ac-a685-01804f6ec8ec.xml.htm">Methods of Controlling Breakpoints</a>.</P>
<P>The WinDbg <b>Breakpoints</b> dialog box displays all breakpoints, indicating unresolved breakpoints with the notation "u". This dialog box can be used to modify any breakpoint.The <b>Command</b> text box on this dialog box can be used to create any type of breakpoint; if the type is omitted, an unresolved breakpoint is created. For details, see <a href="r37_gui_2_5abe2105-cf44-4d1e-a4ae-f4d44409ed58.xml.htm"><b>Edit | Breakpoints</b></a>. When you set a breakpoint by using the mouse in the WinDbg <a href="r36_gui_1_f9c06d65-64ae-4439-bb41-318a12e6c859.xml.htm">Disassembly window</a> or <a href="r36_gui_1_ea5c9fec-a311-4ddc-8418-23737796865f.xml.htm">Source window</a>, the debugger creates an unresolved breakpoint.</P>
