<P>You can also use the WinDbg, CDB, and NTSD to perform limited debugging of target applications that contain managed code.</P>
<H4>Introduction to Managed Code</H4>
<P><i>Managed code</i> is code that is executed together with the Microsoft .NET common language runtime (CLR). The .NET CLR manages raw code and data for the application and provides enhanced services such as garbage collection and platform-independent code.</P>
<P>Compiled code that requires this runtime is called <i>managed code</i>. Code that does not require this runtime is called <i>unmanaged code</i>. An application that consists of only managed code is called a <i>managed application</i>.</P>
<P>A managed .NET application can execute on any platform that supports the .NET CLR because the binary code that the compiler produces is not platform-specific. Binary code in a managed application is in Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL). The binary also includes object information and other references (known as <i>metadata</i>).</P>
<P>A managed application differs from a traditional application because many details of the application's execution are determined by the runtime, such as how data structures are laid out in memory, and how native code is generated and used. When the application is run, the runtime makes decisions about data usage and code usage while the application is running, producing native code that is specific to the platform. The process of generating native code from MSIL is called <i>managing</i> or <i>just-in-time (JIT) compiling</i> (or sometimes <i>JITting</i>). The component of the runtime that performs this translation step is called the <i>JIT compiler</i>.</P>
<P>After the JIT compiler has compiled the MSIL for a specific method, that method's stub is replaced with the address of the compiled code. Whenever this method is later called, the native code executes and the JIT compiler does not have to be involved in the process. </P>
<H4>Building Managed Code</H4>
<P>You can build managed code by using several compilers that are manufactured by a variety of software producers. In particular, Microsoft Visual Studio .NET can build managed code from four different languages:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI>C++ with managed extensions</LI>
<LI>C#</LI>
<LI>Visual Basic</LI>
<LI>JScript</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>By default, Microsoft Visual C++ .NET does not build managed applications. You must request this kind of build through a command-line switch or through the graphical interface.</P>
<H4>Debugging Managed Code</H4>
<P>You can debug managed code by using the <i>Sos.dll</i> extension. This extension is located in the <i>\clr10</i> subdirectory of the Debugging Tools for Windows installation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To use this extension, load it and then type <b>!clr10\sos.help</b>..</P>
<P>This command lists all available extension commands and their parameters.</P>
