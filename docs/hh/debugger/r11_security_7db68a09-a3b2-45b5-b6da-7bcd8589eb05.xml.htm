<P>There are two ways to increase security during remote debugging: by restricting who can connect to your session and by restricting the powers of someone who does connect.</P>
<H4>Controlling Access to the Debugging Session</H4>
<P>If you are performing <a href="r08_use_remote_e8049dea-474e-411d-8286-ec4a646480f7.xml.htm">remote debugging through the debugger</a>, or using a <a href="r08_use_remote_0828c18f-b042-4288-9b58-a56e3076eb2e.xml.htm">process server</a> or <a href="r08_use_remote_da274d6a-0dd9-43db-98cf-5c84038694db.xml.htm">KD connection server</a>, any computer on your local network can attempt to attach to your debugging session.</P>
<P>If you are using the TCP, 1394, COM, or named pipe protocols, you can require the Debugging Client to supply a password. However, this password is not encrypted during transmission, and therefore these protocols are not secure.</P>
<P>If you want your Debugging Server to be secure, you must use secure sockets layer (SSL) or secure pipe (SPIPE) protocol.</P>
<P>If you are performing <a href="r08_use_remote_73c4c537-42b6-451d-b928-2ec0a1357640.xml.htm">remote debugging through <i>remote.exe</i></a>, you can use the <b>/u</b> parameter to prohibit connections from unauthorized users.</P>
<H4>Restricting the Powers of the Client</H4>
<P>If you are setting up a kernel-mode debugging session, you can restrict the debugger's ability to interfere with the host machine by using <a href="r11_security_c67f1beb-2dab-4e98-aa23-02facc89a8f1.xml.htm">Secure Mode</a>.</P>
<P>In user mode, Secure Mode is not available. You can stop an intrusive client from issuing Microsoft MS-DOS commands and running external programs by issuing the <a href="r21_metacmds_l_1d3d0816-860f-4a78-95b6-ac2d40bebd3f.xml.htm"><b>.noshell (Prohibit Shell Commands)</b></a> command. However, there are many other ways for a client to interfere with your computer.</P>
<P>Note that both Secure Mode and <b>.noshell</b> will prevent both the Debugging Client and the Debugging Server from taking certain actions. There is no way to place a restriction on the client but not on the server.</P>
<H4>Forgotten Process Servers</H4>
<P>When you start a process server on a remote machine, the process server runs silently.</P>
<P>If you perform remote debugging through this process server and then end the session, the process server continues to run.</P>
<P>A forgotten process server is a potential target for an attack. You should always shut down an unneeded process server. Use the <i>Kill.exe</i> utility or Task Manager to terminate the process server.</P>
<P></P>
