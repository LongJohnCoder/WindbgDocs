<P>When a user-mode debugger is active, it can effectively control any of the processes on the computer.</P>
<P>There are three possible ways in which security problems could arise during user-mode debugging:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI>If you use corrupt or destructive extension DLLs, they could cause your debugger to take unexpected actions, possibly affecting applications other than your target.</LI>
<LI>It is possible that corrupt or destructive symbol files could also cause your debugger to take unexpected actions, possibly affecting applications other than your target.</LI>
<LI>If you are running a remote debugging session, an unexpected client might attempt to link to your server. Or perhaps the client you <i>are</i> expecting might attempt to perform actions that you do not anticipate.</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>For suggestions on how to guard against unexpected remote connections, see <a href="r11_security_7db68a09-a3b2-45b5-b6da-7bcd8589eb05.xml.htm">Security During Remote Debugging</a>. After a remote client has joined a user-mode debugging session, there is no way to restrict its access to processes on your computer.    </P>
<P>If you are not performing remote debugging, you should still beware of bad symbol files and extension DLLs. do not load symbols or extensions that you distrust!</P>
