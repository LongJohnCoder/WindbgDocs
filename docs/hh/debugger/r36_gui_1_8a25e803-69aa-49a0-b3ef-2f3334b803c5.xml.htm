<P></P>
<P>The Processes and Threads window displays information about the systems, processes, and threads that are being debugged. This window also enables you to select a new system, process, and thread to be active.</P>
<H4>Opening the Processes and Threads Window</H4>
<P>To open or switch to the Processes and Threads window, in the WinDbg window, on the <b>View</b> menu, click <nobr><b>Processes and Threads</b></nobr>. (You can also press ALT+9 or click the <b>Processes and Threads (Alt+9)</b> button (<img src="window-processes-threads.png">) on the toolbar.  ALT+SHIFT+9 will close the Processes and Threads Window.)</P>
<P>The following figure shows an example of a Processes and Threads window.</P>
<p><img src="window-prth.bmp"></p>
<P>The Processes and Threads window displays a list of all processes that are currently being debugged. The threads in the process appear under each process. If the debugger is attached to multiple systems, the systems are shown at the top level of the tree, with the processes subordinate to them, and the threads subordinate to the processes.</P>
<P>Each system listing includes the server name and the protocol details. The system that the debugger is running on is identified as <b>&lt;Local&gt;</b>.</P>
<P>Each process listing includes the internal decimal process ordinal that the debugger uses, the hexadecimal process ID, and the name of the application that is associated with the process.</P>
<P>Each thread listing includes the internal decimal thread ordinal that the debugger uses and the hexadecimal thread ID.</P>
<H4>Using the Processes and Threads Window</H4>
<P>In the Processes and Threads window, you can do the following:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI>To expand or collapse each part of the tree, click the plus sign (<b>+</b>) or minus sign (<b>&#8211;</b>).</LI>
<LI>The <i>current</i> or <i>active</i> system, process, and thread appear in bold type. To make a new system, process, or thread active, click its line in the window.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The Processes and Threads window has a shortcut menu with additional commands. To access the menu, right-click the title bar or click the icon near the upper-right corner of the window (<img src="window-processes-threads.png">). The menu contains the following commands:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI><b>Dock</b> or <b>Undock</b> causes the window to enter or leave the docked state.</LI>
<LI><i>(Menu only)</i>  <b>Move to new dock</b> closes the Processes and Threads window and opens it in a new dock.</LI>
<LI><i>(Menu only)</i> <b>Set as tab-dock target for window type</b> is unavailable for the Processes and Threads window.  This option is only available for <a href="r36_gui_1_ea5c9fec-a311-4ddc-8418-23737796865f.xml.htm">Source</a> or <a href="r36_gui_1_20cff311-cb78-4ad3-a455-7009744a3686.xml.htm">Memory</a> windows.</LI>
<LI><b>Always floating</b> causes the window to remain undocked even if it is dragged to a docking location.</LI>
<LI><b>Move with frame</b> causes the window to move when the WinDbg frame is moved, even if the window is undocked. For more information about docked, tabbed, and floating windows, see <a href="r06_use_gui_b7aca603-cf35-44b2-8cae-541535142929.xml.htm">Positioning the Windows</a>.</LI>
<LI><b>Help</b> opens this topic in the Debugging Tools for Windows documentation.</LI>
<LI><b>Close</b> closes this window.</LI>
