<P>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</P>
<H4>Parameters</H4>
<P>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</P><B></B><table>
<TR valign="top">
<TH Width="">Parameter</TH>

<P></P>
<H4>Cause</H4>
<P>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</P>
<P>This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</P>
<P>If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the page fault include the following: </P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</LI>
<LI>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</LI>
<LI>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer. </LI>
<P></P>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<H4>Resolving the Problem</H4>
<P>To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace.</P>
<P>If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.</P>
