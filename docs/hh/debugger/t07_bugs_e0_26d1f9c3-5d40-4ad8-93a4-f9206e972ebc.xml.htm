<P>The DRIVER_VERIFIER_DMA_VIOLATION bug check has a value of 0x000000E6. This is the bug check code for all Driver Verifier <b>DMA Verification</b> violations.<P></P>

<H4>Parameters</H4>
<P></P>
<P>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen. Parameter 1 is the only parameter of interest. This parameter identifies the exact violation. If a debugger is attached, an informative message is displayed in the debugger.</P><B></B><table>

<H4>Cause</H4>
<P>See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause.</P>
<H4>Resolving the Problem</H4>
<P>This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might also consider removing the driver that caused this problem.</P>
<P>If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.</P>
<P>The Driver Verifier <b>DMA Verification</b> option is only available in Windows XP and later versions. For full details on Driver Verifier, see the Windows Driver Kit.  </P>
