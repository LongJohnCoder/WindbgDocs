<P>See the description of each code in the Parameters section for an explanation of the cause.</P>

<H4>Resolving the Problem</H4>
<P>Typically, the dump file will yield further information on the driver that caused this bug check.</P>
<P>If Parameter 1 is equal to <b>0x2</b>, examine the caller&#8217;s stack to determine the lock in question.</P>
<P>If Parameter 1 is equal to <b>0x3</b>, the driver's Kernel-Mode Driver Framework error log will include details about the outstanding references.</P>
<P>If Parameter 1 is equal to <b>0x4</b>, use the <a href="r17_cmds_i_9b6813c3-7868-43c4-94fb-42e3488dd53a.xml.htm"><b>ln</b> debugger</a> command with the value of <i>Parameter 3</i> as its argument to determine which function requires a non-NULL parameter.</P>
<P>If Parameter 1 is equal to <b>0x7</b>, use the <b>!wdfkd.wdfhandle</b> <i>Parameter 2</i> extension command to determine the handle type. </P>
<P>If Parameter 1 is equal to <b>0xA</b>, then the WDF_QUEUE_FATAL_ERROR_DATA structure will indicate either the problematic request or the queue handle.  It will also indicate the NTSTATUS, if not STATUS_SUCCESS, when available.</P>
