<P>If Windows performance is degrading over time and you suspect that a memory leak may be involved, the technique described in this section can indicate whether there is a memory leak. It will not tell you what the source of the leak is, nor whether it is user mode or kernel mode.</P>
<P>Begin by launching Performance Monitor. Add the following counters:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI><b>Memory</b>&#8212;&gt;<b>Pool Nonpaged Bytes </b></LI>
<LI><b>Memory</b>&#8212;&gt;<b>Pool Paged Bytes </b></LI>
<LI><b>Paging File</b>&#8212;&gt;<b>% Usage </b></LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>Change the update time to 600 seconds to capture a graph of the leak over time. You might also want to log the data to a file for later examination.</P>
<P>Start the application or test that you believe is causing the leak. Allow the application or test to run undisturbed for some time; do not use the target computer during this time. Leaks are usually slow and may take hours to detect. Wait for a few hours before deciding whether a leak has occurred.</P>
<P>Monitor the Performance Monitor counters. After  the test has started, the counter values will change rapidly, and it may take some time for the memory pools values to reach a steady state. </P>
<P>User-mode memory leaks are always located in pageable pool and cause both the <b>Pool Paged Bytes</b> counter and the page file <b>Usage</b> counter to increase steadily over time. Kernel-mode memory leaks usually deplete nonpaged pool, causing the <b>Pool Nonpaged Bytes</b> counter to increase, although pageable memory can be affected as well.  Occasionally these counters may show false positives because an application is caching data. </P>
