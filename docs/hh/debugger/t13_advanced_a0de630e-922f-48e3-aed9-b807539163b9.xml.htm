<P>If you suspect there is a user-mode memory leak but are not sure which process is causing it, you can use Performance Monitor to measure the memory usage of individual processes.</P>
<P>Launch Performance Monitor. Add the following counters:</P><B></B><UL type="disc">
<LI><b>Process</b>&#8212;&gt;<b>Private Bytes</b> (for each process you want to examine) </LI>
<LI><b>Process</b>&#8212;&gt;<b>Virtual Bytes</b> (for each process you wish to examine) </LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>Change the update time to 600 seconds to capture a graph of the leak over time. You might also want to log the data to a file for later examination.</P>
<P>The <b>Private Bytes</b> counter indicates the total amount of memory that a process has allocated, not including memory shared with other processes. The <b>Virtual Bytes</b> counter indicates the current size of the virtual address space that the process is using.</P>
<P>Some memory leaks appear in the data file as an increase in private bytes allocated. Other memory leaks show up as an increase in the virtual address space.</P>
<P>After you have determined which process is leaking memory,  use the UMDH tool to determine the specific routine that is at fault. For details, see <a href="t13_advanced_4ff1ea37-c529-423f-aae9-71c955c35eff.xml.htm">Using UMDH to Find User-Mode Memory Leaks</a>.</P>
